:page-excerpt: In CDI 2.0, you can now create non-contextual instances of beans. This is useful for creating instances of beans that are not managed by the container, such as in a standalone application. In this article, we'll look at how to create non-contextual instances of beans in CDI 2.0.

The king components in CDI are the Beans (check this http://www.next-presso.com/2015/12/how-to-recognize-different-types-of-cdi-beans/[older post^] to all exisitng kind of beans).
In CDI a bean is managed from A to Z by the container, which controls lifecycle of its instance and add all CDI magic on it (injection, interception, etc..).

But sometimes you need to have more control on your components, because you need to create it or destroy it yourself or because it is provided by another container or framework, for instance.

Yet, you'd like to have access to some CDI features for your component like dependency injection or interception.
In that case you'll need to use CDI "non-contextual instance" feature.

To achieve CDI integration, some Java EE spec use the non-contextual instance feature.
For instance, you can think about being able to perform CDI injection in servlets or in entity listeners.
These component are not managed by CDI container, but they are enhanced with some CDI features.

== Two kind of non-contextual instances and two kind of classes

CDI Non-contextual instance may benefit the following services:

* Call of  `@PostConstruct` and `@Predestroy` lifecycle callbacks.
* Dependency injection.
* Destruction of dependent beans instances when the instance is destroyed.
* Interceptors and Decorators.

We can distinguish 2 kinds of non-contextual instances.

The "official" (from the spec point of view) non-contextual instance which is created (i.e. instantiated) by the container and the one instantiated outside the CDI container.

This last kind has no official name in the spec (yet it is fully supported), in this post I'll call them "user instantiated non-contextual instance"
This second kind of non-contextual instance may benefit the following CDI services:

* call of  `@PostConstruct` and `@Predestroy` callbacks.
* CDI dependency injection
* Destruction of dependent beans when the instance is destroyed
* Interception thanks to the new `InterceptionFactory` SPI in CDI 2.0


Both kind of non-contextual instances are enhanced through the `InjectionTargetFactory` SPI.
The classic non-contextual instance is also created and destroyed with the same SPI, but CDI provides an helper class to perform this seamlessly if the class you want to use has already all required annotation (`@Inject` and qualifiers)

== Three different use cases

Thus, when you need to use non-contextual instances, you should first answer to 2 questions

. Can I Let the CDI container create the instance for me?
. Does the class of the instance has already all annotations (@Inject, qualifiers, Interceptor bindings) at class level?

Your answers will make non-contextual instances more or less easy to use:


[cols="20,40,40"]
|===
| |Class has all required annotations |Class lacks some annotations

|Container can instantiate
|You can use `Unmanaged` helper class
.2+|You'll have to use `InjectionTargetFactory` and `AnnotatedTypeConfigurator` SPI

|You provide the instance
|You'll have to use `InjectionTargetFactory` SPI

|===


=== Use case 1: Non-contextual instance for a class having all required annotations

This is the simplest use case.

Since CDI 1.1, the API provide the http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/api/2.0/javax/enterprise/inject/spi/Unmanaged.html[`Unmanaged` helper class^] that hides all the work done with `InjectionTargetFactory` produce a non-contextual instance:


[source,java]
----
public void doSomethingWithContextualMyClass() {
    Unmanaged<MyClass> unmanagedMyClass = new Unmanaged<MyClass>(MyClass.class); //<1>
    Unmanaged.UnmanagedInstance<MyClass> umc = unmanagedMyClass.newInstance(); //<2>
    umc.produce().inject().postConstruct(); //<3>
    MyClass myInstance = umc.get(); //<4>

    //Do what you need with myInstance

    umc.preDestroy(); //<5>
    umc.dispose(); //<6>
}
----
<1> Instantiate an instance of `Unmanaged` for `MyClass`
<2> Request a new instance handler (providing all services and data for a given instance)
<3> These invocation create the instance, perform dependency injection and call the `@PostConstruct` lifecycle call back
<4> retrieving the effective instance
<5> call the `@Predestroy` lifecycle callback
<6> perform destruction of the instance context (i.e. release all `@Dependent` instances injected in the instance)

Keep in mind that letting the container producing the instance (`produce()` method) activate optional interceptors and decorators on the instance.

In this case, the class shouldn't be unproxyable as detailed in the http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html#unproxyable[spec^].

`Unmanaged.UnmanagedInstance` is an important handler that gives you access to all CDI services for the instance you want to obtain, but it should also be kept to perform the `dispose()` task, which release all dependent beans instances that were created with your instance.
Without this call you may face memory leaks in your application

=== Use case 2: Non-contextual instance whose class doesn't have the required annotation

Unfortunately, `Unmanaged` doesn't provide access to the underlying `AnnotatedType` for the instance class.

So if you need to add annotations to the metadata model because they are missing on the original class, you'll have to use the `InjectionTargetFactory` provided by the container.
Note that Unmanaged does the same under the hood.

To request an `InjectionTargetFactory` from the container, you'll need first to access the `BeanManager`.

If you are in CDI programming model (i.e in a CDI bean) simply inject the BeanManager to access it

[source,java]
----
@Inject
BeanManager bm;
----

If are not CDI programming model, the easiest way to access the `BeanManager` is ot use the `CDI` class available since CDI 1.1 (note that it also works in CDI programming model even if direct injection is still preferred to static call done with `CDI.current()`).

[source,java]
----
BeanManager bm = CDI.current().getBeanManager();
----

In certain circumstance, you may want to retrieve the `BeanManager` from a JNDI lookup through the `java:comp/BeanManager`, JNDI name.

The following example show how to create a non-contextual instance from `MyClass` in which you need to create an injection point (add `@Inject`) on the field `MyField`

[source,java]
----
public void doSomethingWithContextualMyClass() {
        BeanManager bm = CDI.current().getBeanManager();  //<1>
        InjectionTargetFactory<MyClass> itf = bm
                .getInjectionTargetFactory(bm.createAnnotatedType(MyClass.class)); //<2>
        itf.configure() //<3>
                .filterFields(f -> "MyField".equals(f.getJavaMember().getName()))
                .findFirst()
                .ifPresent(f -> f.add(InjectLiteral.INSTANCE)); //<4>
        InjectionTarget<MyClass> it = itf.createInjectionTarget(null); //<5>
        CreationalContext<MyClass> cctx = bm.createCreationalContext(null); //<6>
        MyClass myInstance = it.produce(cctx); //<7>
        it.postConstruct(myInstance); //<7>
        it.inject(myInstance,cctx); //<7>

        //Do what you need with myInstance

        it.preDestroy(myInstance); //<8>
        cctx.release(); //<9>
}
----
<1> retrieving the `BeanManager`
<2> requesting an `InjectionTargetFactory` from the `BeanManager`
<3> using the new `AnnotatedTypeConfigurator` SPI in CDI 2.0 to configure the underlying `AnnotatedType`. Before CDI 2.0 you'd have to implement `AnnotatedType` to add your annotation and use it in previous step (2)
<4> looking for the `MyField` field and adding `@Inject` to it (we use the new `InjectLiteral` introduced in CDI 2.0)
<5> creating the `InjectionTarget`. As it's for a non-contextual instance, we create it by passing null (no bean) to the method
<6> creating the `CreationalContext`. As it's for a non-contextual instance, we create it by passing null (no bean) to the method
<7> creating the instance, performing `@PostConstruct` lifecycle call back and injection
<8> call the `@Predestroy` lifecycle callback
<9> release the `CreationalContext` and all the dependents bean instances

Note, that, we could also have added interceptor bindings to the `AnnotatedTypeConfigurator` during step (3).
In this case, `MyClass` shouldn't be unproxyable as detailed in the http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html#unproxyable[spec^].


=== Use case 3: User Instantiated non-contextual instance

If the instance is provided by the user, code is roughly the same

[source,java]
----
public void doSomethingWithContextualMyClass() {
        BeanManager bm = CDI.current().getBeanManager();
        InjectionTargetFactory<MyClass> itf = bm.getInjectionTargetFactory(bm.createAnnotatedType(MyClass.class));
        itf.configure()
                .filterFields(f -> "MyField".equals(f.getJavaMember().getName()))
                .findFirst()
                .ifPresent(f -> f.add(InjectLiteral.INSTANCE));
        InjectionTarget<MyClass> it = itf.createInjectionTarget(null);
        CreationalContext<MyClass> cctx = bm.createCreationalContext(null);
        MyClass myInstance = new MyClass(); //<1>
        it.postConstruct(myInstance);
        it.inject(myInstance,cctx);

        //Do what you need with myInstance

        it.preDestroy(myInstance);
        cctx.release();
}
----
<1> instance is not created by the container

In that case the instance won't have interceptor applied on it since the container didn't create it.

In CDI 2.0, you can use the new `InterceptorFactory` SPI to fix that.

[source,java]
----
public void doSomethingWithContextualMyClass() {
        BeanManager bm = CDI.current().getBeanManager();
        InjectionTargetFactory<MyClass> itf = bm.getInjectionTargetFactory(bm.createAnnotatedType(MyClass.class));
        itf.configure()
                .filterFields(f -> "MyField".equals(f.getJavaMember().getName()))
                .findFirst()
                .ifPresent(f -> f.add(InjectLiteral.INSTANCE));
        InjectionTarget<MyClass> it = itf.createInjectionTarget(null);
        CreationalContext<MyClass> cctx = bm.createCreationalContext(null);
        InterceptionFactory<MyClass> ifm = bm.createInterceptionFactory(cctx, MyClass.class); //<1>
        ifm.configure() //<2>
                .add(new AnnotationLiteral<Transactional>() {
                });

        MyClass myInstance = ifm.createInterceptedInstance(new MyClass()); //<3>
        it.postConstruct(myInstance);
        it.inject(myInstance,cctx);

        //Do what you need with myInstance

        it.preDestroy(myInstance);
        cctx.release();
    }
----
<1> requesting an `InterceptionFactory` for `MyClass`.
<2> configure the annotation on the underlying class. Here we add `@Transactional` on the class but we could have done it on a given method
<3> Instantiating MyClass and applying interceptor on it

== Conclusion

So we covered all the use cases for non-contextual instance creation and management in CDI.

All these use cases can also be implemented in CDI 1.1 with more verbose code (except the last example, since `InterceptionFactory` was only introduced in 2.0).

Keep in mind that except for `Unmanaged`, all the SPI elements shown in this post are also very useful when creating custom bean.

`InterceptionFactory` is also very useful to apply interceptors in a producer.
